these are the things you must carefully do to run this code
You will need to put the Integrate.py into a folder and specify its location in CompareIntegrate.py code. The Integrate.py contains my Integration class which has all of my integration methods.
2. Run the CompareIntegrate.py code. I used python3 IntCompare.py to run. It should then output the area values for two different numerical integration methods, as well as, their respective errors. It should also output the exact value of the integral last.
3. you can change the bounds of integration by changoing a and b in the code. Likewise, you can change the function here as well. The number of rectangles is changed by changing n.
